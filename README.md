# Machine Learning Internship With BharatIntern
## Description
This repository contains Jupyter notebook code for three machine learning tasks completed during my Bharat Intern virtual internship.

## Usage
Each task is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook. You can open and run these notebooks to explore the code and see the results.

## Data
The datasets utilized in the `House Price Prediction` and `Wine Quality Prediction` tasks have been sourced from a Kaggle competition. You can access the datasets by referring to the respective Jupyter notebook files, where I have provided direct links to the Kaggle competition pages for data retrieval.
Additionally, for the `Iris Flower Classification task`, the dataset is sourced from Scikit-learn and can be readily utilized within the Jupyter notebook without the need for external downloads.

## Results
Detailed results and accuracy for each task are available within the corresponding Jupyter notebook.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Bharat Intern for the internship opportunity.
